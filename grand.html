                The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), located near the Pyramids of Giza, is set to be the largest archaeological museum in the world. It will house over 100,000 ancient Egyptian artifacts, including the complete collection of Tutankhamunâ€™s treasures, many of which will be displayed for the first time.

Designed with a modern touch, the museum blends cutting-edge architecture with ancient history. Once fully open, it will become a major cultural and tourist destination, showcasing the legacy of ancient Egypt in one spectacular location.
