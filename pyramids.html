                The Pyramids and the Great Sphinx of Giza
            </h1>
            <h3>
                Located on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, the Pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx stand as timeless monuments to ancient Egyptian civilization. The three main pyramids—Khufu (or Cheops), Khafre, and Menkaure—were built over 4,500 years ago as grand tombs for pharaohs. Towering above the desert sands, these structures reflect astonishing architectural skill and alignments with celestial bodies, showcasing the Egyptians' advanced knowledge of engineering and astronomy.

Guarding the plateau is the Great Sphinx, a colossal limestone statue with the body of a lion and the head of a pharaoh, believed to represent Khafre. The Sphinx, with its mysterious expression, adds a layer of myth and legend to the site, fueling centuries of fascination and speculation. Together, the pyramids and the Sphinx are more than ancient ruins—they are enduring symbols of human ingenuity, cultural legacy, and the mysteries of the past.
