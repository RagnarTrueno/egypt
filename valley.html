                 Is an ancient burial site in Egypt, located on the west bank of the Nile near Luxor. It was used from the 18th to the 20th Dynasties (circa 1550â€“1070 BCE) to bury pharaohs and powerful nobles. Unlike pyramids, the tombs were carved into the rock to protect the pharaohs' remains and treasures. Famous tombs include that of Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter. The valley is known for its elaborate paintings and inscriptions, offering insight into ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. It remains a key archaeological site and popular tourist attraction.
